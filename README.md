**Note üìù:** when browsing unity package manager, you will always get an error:
```
[Package Manager Window] Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to perform online search:
  Request [GET https://npm.pkg.github.com/@rlty-live/-/v1/search?text=live.rlty&from=0&size=250] failed with status code [405] [NotFound].
```
This is because GitHub doesn't have an API to get package list. You should ignore this error.
